    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), by incorporating external knowledge with parametric memory of language models, has become the state-of-the-art architecture for opendomain QA tasks. However, common knowledge bases are inherently constrained by limited coverage and noisy information, making retrieval-based approaches inadequate to answer implicit reasoning questions. In this paper, we propose an Induction-Augmented Generation (IAG) framework that utilizes inductive knowledge along with the retrieved documents for implicit reasoning. We leverage large language models (LLMs) for deriving such knowledge via a novel prompting method based on inductive reasoning patterns. On top of this, we implement two versions of IAG named IAG-GPT and IAG-Student, respectively. IAG-GPT directly utilizes the knowledge generated by GPT-3 for answer prediction, while IAG-Student gets rid of dependencies on GPT service at inference time by incorporating a student inductor model. The inductor is firstly trained via knowledge distillation and further optimized by back-propagating the generator feedback via differentiable beam scores. Experimental results show that IAG outperforms RAG baselines as well as ChatGPT on two Open-Domain QA tasks. Notably, our best models have won the first place in the official leaderboards of CSQA2.0 (since Nov 1, 2022) and StrategyQA (since Jan 8, 2023).",

                "Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) (Zhu et al., 2021) has attracted increasing research attention. Compared with the closed-domain setting, techniques developed upon ODQA models can empower search engines with the ability to respond to a wider range of user queries. As a typical knowledge-intensive task, ODQA has been extensively studied within the scope of information retrieval (Karpukhin et al., 2020;Das et al., 2019;Sachan et al., 2021), where access to external knowledge sources such as web pages or knowledge bases is required. Another line of research exploits large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and PaLM as the knowledge source (Petroni et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2022b) and develops various prompting methods to elicit knowledge from LLMs that is implicitly encoded in the parameters. However, to answer reasoning questions, i.e., questions that demand some degree of reasoning ability, either retrieval-based or prompting-based approaches suffer from their intrinsic limitations.",
                "On the one hand, although RAG (Lewis et al., 2020) has become the SOTA architecture for ODQA, documents retrieved from common knowledge bases generally suffer from the limitations of constrained coverage and noisy information, especially for implicit reasoning questions whose answers are not well documented. For example, it's trivial for an average child to answer questions such as \"can you catch a jellyfish in the dumpster?\". However, it's unlikely to find the answer directly from the web or books. As shown in Figure 1, the retrieved documents can hardly answer the question in such cases. Hence, relying entirely on information retrieval is insufficient to solve implicit reasoning questions.",
                "On the other hand, prompting-based methods can exploit the considerable amount of knowledge encoded in the parameters of LLMs for QA tasks (Wang et al., 2022;Wei et al., 2022;Chowdhery et al., 2022;Brown et al., 2020). But the problem of hallucination (i.e., generating natural language statements that are factually incorrect) imposes limitations on LLMs in terms of factuality and credibility. To better control the knowledge elicited from LLMs, various prompting methods such as chainof-thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022)   until arriving at the conclusion. However, capability of the an LLM is intrinsically constrained by its parameter size, making it unable to respond correctly to domain-specific questions beyond the scope of its training corpus.",
                "In view of the above challenges, it requires a new paradigm for building models applicable to reasoning QA. To this end, we combine the advantages of these two kinds of methods and propose IAG, an Induction-Augmented Generation framework for answering implicit reasoning questions. IAG enhances the conventional RAG with an inductor that generates inductive knowledge w.r.t each question. To derive such knowledge, we propose a novel prompting method, which is intuitively inspired by the cognitive functions of inductive reasoning, to elicit inductive knowledge from an LLM (i.e., GPT-3). Our first implementation of IAG, which is termed IAG-GPT, directly leverages the knowledge statements sampled from GPT-3 as evidence alongside the retrieved documents to feed into the answer generator. We show that IAG-GPT improves over SOTA models on multiple ODQA datasets and has won the first place in the official leaderboards of CSQA2.0 and StrategyQA. We also implement IAG-Student, the second variant that gets rid of dependencies on GPT service during inference, by training a student inductor model following a twostep optimization scheme. Specifically, the model is firstly warmed up through distillation by using the GPT-3 statements as pseudo labels, and then further optimized with a novel TAILBACK approach: gradienT bAck-propagation dIfferentiabLe BeAm sCores feedbacK. TAILBACK implements a differentiable beam search algorithm for the inductor and allows the feedback from the generator to be back-propagated to the inductor via beam scores. We verify that IAG-Student improves over RAG baselines on a smaller architecture.",
                "The contributions of this paper include: 1) an inductive prompting method which improves the factuality of knowledge elicited from LLMs by constructing a reasoning path via inductive reasoning; 2) an IAG-GPT implementation that improves over strong baseline models and ChatGPT by leveraging the knowledge elicited from GPT-3 as auxiliary supporting evidence for the generator; 3) a TAILBACK optimization algorithm to train the inductor which allows IAG-Student to outperform RAG baselines under a small model size."

                "Open-Domain Reasoning QA. Retrieval-based approaches (Guu et al., 2020;Lewis et al., 2020) have been extensively explored to cope with ODQA tasks (Chen et al., 2017). Recent studies have focused on solving ODQA tasks that require certain sorts of reasoning, either explicitly or implicitly. Explicit reasoning tasks, such as Hotpot QA (bridge setting) (Yang et al., 2018), require the models to iteratively decompose the question and fetch new evidence until arriving at the answer. Implicit reasoning tasks, such as StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) and CSQA (without commonsense knowledge base) (Talmor et al., 2021), can be more difficult to solve since the answers are generally not present as plain text in web pages or knowledge bases. To solve implicit reasoning tasks, two kinds of methods have been proposed, i.e., RAG and prompting. The former retrieves evidence based on the decomposed questions and relies on the generator to implicitly reason over the evidence (Perez et al., 2020). But this approach becomes fragile when retrieved documents contain too little useful information or too much noise. The latter teaches LLMs to reason over questions by few-shot demonstration (Wei et al., 2022;Chowdhery et al., 2022). But prompting templates are generally task-specific and LLMs are prone to hallucinations. Our proposed framework combines the advantages of these two methods.",
                "Prompting-Based Reasoning. Few-shot prompting is a mainstream approach to eliciting knowledge from LLMs (Brown et al., 2020;Chowdhery et al., 2022;Ma et al., 2022;Liu et al., 2022a).",
                "To answer implicit reasoning questions, various prompting methods have been proposed among which CoT (Wei et al., 2022) has attracted the most research interest in the earlier research. It allows LLMs to answer complex questions in a step-bystep manner. Follow-up studies include enhancing the consistency of CoT (Wang et al., 2022) and improving the correctness of the reasoning steps. Recently, adaptive prompting methods have been shown to achieve better performance on reasoning tasks such as bABI (Weston et al., 2016) and ProofWriter (Tafjord et al., 2021). For example, the Selection-Inference (SI) framework (Creswell et al., 2022) alternates between selection and inference to generate a series of interpretable reasoning steps. LAMBADA (Kazemi et al., 2022) proposes the idea of backward chaining and employs four LLM-based sub-modules for reasoning. However, SI and LAMBDA rely on heuristic search algorithms performed in a limited context space, which cannot be easily adapted to open-domain reasoning tasks. The inductive prompting proposed in this paper can be used for general-purpose knowledge elicitation.",

                "Recently, exploiting LLMs (e.g., GPT-3) for QA tasks has attracted increasing research interest due to their abilities to store factual knowledge and perform reasoning. Representing knowledge as freeform text qualifies LLMs as high-coverage knowledge bases for various domains, but the knowledge elicited from LLMs is prone to factual errors that can be detrimental to downstream tasks. Existing approaches to this problem either focus on arithmetic reasoning or commonsense reasoning tasks that involve multiple reasoning steps (Wei et al., 2022) or cannot be easily adapted to open-domain settings (Creswell et al., 2022;Kazemi et al., 2022).",
                "To enhance the credibility of the statements generated by LLMs, we propose a prompting method that is intuitively inspired by the idea of inductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking that draws general conclusions from specific observations, during which analogy and generalization are two fundamental cognitive tools. Analogical reasoning allows us to establish connections between two similar objects and infer new information about one object based on what is known about the other. Generalization involves exploiting category information to generalize from the known to the unknown. As an example, consider the question shown in Figure 1. By analogical reasoning, one might conjecture that jellyfish, just like crabs and shrimps, are seldom found in dumpsters because these animals are similar in terms of inhabitants. By generalization, the fact that jellyfish are aquatic animals can support the hypothesis that they live in the water instead of in dumpsters.",
                "Based on the above cognitive functions, we propose a prompting method that guides LLMs to generate knowledge statements w.r.t. the question by building a two-step reasoning path, formally given as:",
                "Question: A statement about target. Knowledge: Target, analog#1, analog#2 are hypernym. An assertion about hypernym.",
                "The knowledge statement is formulated as a reasoning path consisting of two sentences. The first sentence categorizes the target into its conceptual hypernym by associating two analogs that share some commonalities. And the second sentence states a fact about the hypernym that is contextually related to the topic of the question.",
                "As an example, consider the question shown in Figure 1. Regarding jellyfish as target, its analogs are crabs and shrimps, and its hypernym is aquatic animals. Hence, the reasoning path can be constructed as follows: Jellyfish, crabs and shrimps are aquatic animals. You can't catch aquatic animals in the dumpster. We follow the above inductive reasoning pattern and construct a prompting template consisting of 5 in-context demonstrations. The template is presented in Appendix A."

We leverage the prompting method described in Section 3.2 to generate inductive knowledge for each question. Inspired by (Wang et al., 2022), we proposed to enhance the validity of the result by aggregating multiple knowledge statements. However, instead of explicitly voting on multiple results, we let the generator implicitly reason over the collection of all sampled knowledge statements.",

During training, the generator learns to predict the correct answer based on a diverse set of knowledge statements, making it robust to the noise present in the provided evidence. During inference, providing a richer set of evidence avoids the problem of local optimality in greedy decoding and has a better chance of yielding the knowledge statement that best prompts the generator."

In the first step, we warm it up via a distillation method, i.e., the knowledge statements elicited from GPT-3 are used as pseudo labels to train the inductor with a seq2seq loss. In the second step, we perform further optimization using a novel scheme TAILBACK that back-propagates the feedback from the generator to the inductor via differentiable beam scores.",
                "Step 1: Distillation For each question-answer pair (q, a * ) in the training set, we sample N different knowledge statements from GPT-3 using inductive prompting described in Section 3.2. The generated statements for the question are denoted as K = {K n } N n=1 . Besides, each question-answer pair is accompanied by the top-M documents ranked by the retriever, represented as R = {R m } M m=1 . Instead of directly supervising the inductor using all the knowledge statements generated by GPT-3, we claim that different statements should be distinguished according to their respective confidence during distillation.

This result suggests that LLMs, even as strong as ChatGPT, can suffer from hallucination problems without access to retrieved factual evidence. Hence, combining prompting methods with information retrieval empowers IAG-GPT to answer reasoning questions more reliably.

                "To verify the effectiveness of inductive prompting, we compare IAG-GPT with two other baseline prompting methods. The first baseline is an ablated version of IAG-GPT that elicits knowledge from GPT-3 using a trivial prompt without inductive reasoning. The template for trivial prompting is presented in Table 6. The second baseline directly derives answers from GPT-3 via chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting using the prompt proposed in their original paper (Wei et al., 2022). For the second baseline, we experiment with two implemen-  (Talmor et al., 2021) 74.0 ---T5-11B (Talmor et al., 2021) 74.1 ---GKP (Liu et al., 2022b) 72.4 ---ChatGPT (Ouyang et   The experiment is conducted on the StrategyQA dev set and the scores are reported in Table 2. As shown, our proposed IAG framework outperforms CoT methods by a large margin. This result indicates that compared to relying entirely on GPT-3 for answer prediction, combining the knowledge elicited from GPT-3 with information retrieval is a better way of utilizing LLMs for QA tasks. Also, we find that inductive reasoning is better than trivial prompting at providing the generator with useful knowledge for answer prediction. Table 9 lists some cases comparing different methods.",
                "Limitations of Inductive Prompting. Although inductive prompting proves to be more effective in producing insightful knowledge, we have to admit that it can fail and generate faulty statements sometimes. Take the third question listed in Table 8 as an example, GPT-3 claims that \"Beverages are not capable of drowning someone\". As another example, given the question \"Cotton candy is sometimes made out of cotton?\", GPT-3 generates the following statements \"Cotton, wool, and silk are fabrics. Cotton candy is made out of spun sugar or fabric\". We attribute these failures to the fact that, although indutive prompting helps establish the connection between a concept and its hypernym, correctly predicting a fact related to the hypernym still depends on the internal knowledge of the language model, which is error-prone for tricky or long-tail questions."

This can be at- tributed to the fact that some knowledge statements sampled from GPT-3 are less useful for answer prediction. Using these statements indiscriminately can inevitably introduce noise and disturb the optimization of the inductor. As for Q Max , leveraging feedback from the generator allows the inductor to learn from the best knowledge statement. But the size of the training data set is much smaller (only a fraction of 1 N generated statements are used). In comparison, Q Weight achieves the best performance among all the strategies by supervising the inductor with a more diverse set of GPT-3 statements while suppressing the effect of low-contribution ones. Hence Q Weight is adopted for the rest of the experiments."

It can be shown in Table 3 that, introducing the inductor model significantly promotes the performance on StrategyQA, whereas little improvement is observed on CSQA2.0. Since most questions in CSQA2.0 can be readily answered by using the retrieved documents, the inductive knowledge become less useful. However, solving StrategyQA requires implicit reasoning over multiple documents. When the retrieved documents fail to provide useful clues, our inductor can compensate for the missing information.",

Table 4 compares different methods including the retrieval-only baseline. The knowledge fusion mechanism is obviously superior to the selfconsistency approach. We hypothesize that fusing all knowledge statements allows the generator to have a holistic view of all evidence and make informed decisions.

                "Table 8 lists some cases where the retrieved documents fail to provide informative evidence whereas the inductive knowledge stands out. Typical failures of retrieval-based approaches can be categorized into two occasions. Firstly, when the knowledge required for answering the question is too scarce to be found, the retriever could fetch documents that hardly match the semantics of the question (e.g., Q3). Secondly, when the question is too trivial and the answer is unlikely to be officially documented, the retrievals could contain specific cases that contradict the commonsense conclusion (e.g., brittle failure of steel for Q1 and unequal leg length for Q2).",
                "Besides, the results on different setups of IAG-GPT suggest that, the relative contributions of the retrieval and the inductive knowledge can be different, depending on the tasks. As shown in Table 1, for CSQA2.0, higher scores are reported for retrieval only than for induction only, while the result is contrary for StrategyQA. These results can be attributed to the fact that questions in StrategyQA (e.g., Would a cattle farmer be useful to a drum maker?) require better reasoning ability to answer.",
                "To fully verify the effectiveness of the inductive knowledge, we compare the performance of IAG based on two different settings: 1) using 10 retrievals and 2) using 5 retrievals and 5 knowledge statements. The results are shown in Table 7. For CSQA2.0, using more retrievals yields a slightly better result, while for StrategyQA, introducing knowledge statements significantly boosts the performance. This finding is consistent with our previous conclusion that our method works better for reasoning-intensive QA tasks. For CSQA2.0, many commonsense questions can be solved by referring to plain-text records by retrieving methods. However, for StrategyQA, the answers are unlikely to be directly extracted from the retrieved documents but require reasoning over multiple documents to obtain. In such cases, introducing inductive knowledge can be very useful. This is also the reason why the marginal performance gains are more significant for StrategyQA than for CSQA2.0 when inductive knowledge is offered besides the retrieved documents."
