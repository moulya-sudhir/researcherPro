       " 'abstract': 'User simulators are agents designed to imitate human users; recent advances have found that Task-oriented Dialogue (ToD) systems optimized toward a user simulator could better satisfy the need of human users. However, this might result in a sub-optimal ToD system if it is tailored to only one ad hoc user simulator, since human users can behave differently. In this paper, we propose a framework called MUST 1 to optimize ToD systems via leveraging Multiple User SimulaTors. The main challenges of implementing the MUST are 1) how to adaptively determine which user simulator to interact with the ToD system at each optimization step, since the ToD system might be over-fitted to some specific user simulators, and simultaneously underfitted to some others; 2) how to avoid catastrophic forgetting of the adaption for a simulator that is not selected for several consecutive optimization steps. To tackle these challenges, we formulate MUST as a Multi-armed bandits (MAB) problem and provide a method called MUST adaptive that balances i) the boosting adaption for adaptive interactions between different user simulators and the ToD system and ii) the uniform adaption to avoid the catastrophic forgetting issue. With both automatic evaluations and human evaluations, our experimental results on MultiWOZ show that the dialogue system trained by MUST achieves a better performance than those trained by a single user simulator. It also has a better generalization ability when testing with unseen user simulators.',\n",

Training task-oriented dialogue systems in supervised learning approaches often requires a large amount of expert-labeled dialogues, however collecting these dialogues is usually expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, even with a large amount of dialogue data, some dialogue states may not be explored sufficiently for dialogue systems 2 (Li et al., 2016b). To this end, many researchers try to build user simulators to mimic human users for generating reasonable and natural conversations. By using a user simulator and sampling user goals, we can train the dialogue system from scratch with reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Previous works tend to design better user simulator models (Schatzmann et al., 2007;Asri et al., 2016;Gur et al., 2018;Kreyssig et al., 2018;Lin et al., 2021). Especially, Shi et al.

There exist several simple ways to implement the MUST framework, including a merging strategy, a continual reinforcement learning (CRL) strategy, and a uniform adaption strategy, namely MUST merging , MUST CRL , and MUST uniform respectively (See §3.2). However, none of them could effectively tackle the challenges: 1) how to efficiently leverage multiple user simulators to train the dialogue system since the system might be easily over-fitted to some specific user simulators and simultaneously under-fitted to some others, and 2) it should avoid a catastrophic forgetting issue. To tackle them effectively, we first formulate the problem as a Multi-armed bandits (MAB) problem (Auer et al., 2002); similar to the exploitation vs exploration trade-off, specifying multiple user simulators should trade off a boosting adaption (tackling challenge 1) and a uniform adaption (tackling challenge 2), see §4.1 for more details.

Researchers usually divide the task-oriented dialogue systems into four modules (Wen et al., 2017;Ham et al., 2020;Peng et al., 2021): Natural Language Understanding (NLU) (Liu and Lane, 2016) that first comprehends user's intents and extracts the slots-values pairs, Dialog State Tracker (DST) (Williams et al., 2013) that tracks the values of slots, Dialog Policy Learning (POL) (Peng et al., 2017(Peng et al., , 2018) ) that decides the dialog actions, and Natural Language Generation (NLG) (Wen et al., 2015;Peng et al., 2020) that translates the dialog actions into a natural-language form. The DST module and the POL module usually are collectively referred to as the dialogue manager (DM) (Chen et al., 2017). These different modules can be trained independently or jointly in an end-to-end manner (Wen et al., 2017;Liu and Lane, 2018;Ham et al., 2020;Peng et al., 2021).\",\n",
       "    \"User simulator. The user simulator is also an agent but plays a user role. Different from dialogue systems, the user agent has a goal describing a target entity (e.g., a restaurant at a specific location) and should express its goal completely in an organized way by interacting with the system agent (Takanobu et al., 2020). Therefore, besides the modules of NLU, DM, and NLG like dialogue systems, the user agent should have another module called Goal Generator (Kreyssig et al., 2018), which is responsible for generating the user's goal. Building a user simulator could usually use an agenda-based approach (Schatzmann et al., 2007;Schatzmann and Young, 2009) designing handcrafted rules to mimic user behaviors or a model-based approach such as neural networks (Asri et al., 2016;Kreyssig et al., 2018;Gur et al., 2018) learned on a corpus of dialogues.\",\n",

However, users' goals are invisible to the system agent. Then the system agent tends to gradually understand the users' utterances, query the database to find entities, and provide useful information to accomplish users' task. When the database result returned by the system agent is empty, the user agent should learn to compromise and change its goal with the help of Goal Generator. When the dialogue ends, the user simulator will reward the system agent according to if it accomplishes the task. Then we could use the reward to update the system agent with RL algorithms (Tseng et al., 2021).\"],\n",

Dialogues consist of multiple turns. In the first turn t = 0, U-GPT (1) first outputs its NLU results N 0 by understanding the system input S 0 , and (3) decide its actions A 0 which is a list of pairs: (action_type, slot_name) based on (2) its initial goal G 0 and {S 0 , N 0 }. U-GPT then (4) conditions on {S 0 , N 0 , G 0 , A 0 } to generate the delexicalized utterance U 0 . The generated placeholders in U 0 will be filled using the corresponding slot values in the goal G 0 . When the conversation proceeds to turn t, U-GPT (1) generates the  NLU results N t based on all of previous dialogue history and generated outputs {C 0 , . . . , C t−1 , S t }, here',\n",

We evaluate a user simulator indirectly using the average success rate of the system agent trained by this simulator. It is called crossmodel evaluation (Schatzmann and Young, 2009) which assumes a strategy learned with a good user model still performs well when tested on poor user models. It can indirectly evaluate the goodness of a user simulator. For direct evaluations, we adopt six evaluation measures to evaluate the diversity of user simulators automatically: average utterance length, vocabulary size, Dist-1, Dist-2 (Li et al., 2016a) and Entropy (Zhang et al., 2018). We also ask human users to rate the simulated dialogues 9 to assess the user simulators directly. We use five same metrics as Shi et al. (2019) which are Fluency, Coherence, Goal Adherence, Diversity, and Overall quality to assess user simulators from multiple aspects.'],\n",

However, as Tab. 13 shows, RNNT performs better than our GPT-RNN in the overall performance from the human evaluation. We think this might be because (1) the third-party system also has an impact on the generated dialogues and (2) the NLG module of RNNT is the template-based method which leads to the generated dialogues from RNNT being easy for the third-party system to understand and interact with.',\n",

We think it is because the user utterances generated by RNNR are retrieved from a corpus that is written by real humans and the sentences written by humans are usually more diverse than the sentences generated by generative models. Even though the dialogues generated by RNNR are more diverse, the dialogues generated by our GPT-RNN are more fluent and coherent. Also, the cross-model evaluation results in Tab. 11 show that GPT-RNN can help to learn a more robust system agent than RNNR, but the Hu.All score in the human evaluation in Tab. 13 gives the opposite result.
